# Lakhs & Crores Converter

Ever look at a number like "â‚¹15 crore" and have absolutely no idea what that means in dollars? Same.

This is a simple converter I built to make sense of Indian number notation (lakhs, crores) as an American. It converts between USD and INR with live exchange rates and shows both numbering systems side by side.

Turns out 1 crore = 10 million. 1 lakh = 100,000. Who knew? Now we do.
